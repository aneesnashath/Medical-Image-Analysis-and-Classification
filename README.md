MedAI: Medical Image Analysis with Deep Learning
MedAI is a deep learning system designed for medical image analysis, focusing on PathMNIST and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. It offers:

Data loading and verification from MedMNIST2D dataset
Data normalization and formatting for multidimensional images
Visualization of data subsets and ground truth
Data pre-processing and optional augmentation
Intelligent train-test data splitting to handle imbalances
Four deep learning models developed with Keras (2 for PathMNIST, 2 for PneumoniaMNIST)
Performance evaluation metrics (F1, precision, recall, accuracy, confusion matrix)
Interactive Unity-based application for seamless image upload and classification
